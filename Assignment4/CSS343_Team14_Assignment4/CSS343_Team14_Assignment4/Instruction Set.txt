1. Create a store object
2. At that point you can give it several file names, one for customer, movies, and commands, or you can wait
and do it later. 
3. If you chose to wait you can call the read movies from file, read commands from file, and read customers from
file directly.
4. There are no other known means of communicating with the store except through files.
5. The rest should be handled by the program dirrectly.
